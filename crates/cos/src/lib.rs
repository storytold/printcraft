//! pdfcraft-cos — the PDF object layer (L1, standalone with `pdfcraft-filters`).
//!
//! Parses the COS object graph lazily and tolerantly, keeps edits in a copy-on-write overlay
//! (cheap snapshots for undo), and writes documents back either incrementally (original bytes
//! untouched) or as a full, garbage-collected rewrite. The PDF object graph *is* PdfCraft's
//! document model (plan/architecture.md §5, ADR-0010).
//!
//! Done: every cross-reference form (tables, streams, hybrid `/XRefStm`), object streams, repair
//! by scanning, encryption on load and save (R2–R6, crypt filters, `/EFF`), incremental writing,
//! and full saves that pack objects into compressed object streams with a cross-reference stream.
//! Not yet: streaming very large files within a memory budget (`ByteSource`,
//! `core.lazy-loading`), and linearized output (`core.linearization`, M11). See the README.
